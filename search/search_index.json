The bond is issued by RBI on behalf of the Government of India. Each unit of the bond is equivalent to a gram of gold. The price of the bond is linked to the price of the gold. The price is calculated by taking the average of the closing price of gold of 999 purity for the last 3 business days of the week. RBI follows the price of gold published by IBJA.</p> <p>The bond also includes an interest component. The interest is paid every 6 months. The initial bonds were issued with 2.75% interest. Nowadays the interest is 2.5%. The interest is taxable as per the income tax slab of the investor. Any capital gains on the bond are exempted if you hold the bond till maturity. The bond has an 8 year term with an exit option available from the 5<sup>th</sup> year onward. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use Paisa to effectively track your SGBs and calculate your returns.</p> <p>Let's assume you have <code>25,000 INR</code> in your bank account.</p> <pre><code>2015/11/01 Opening Balance\n    Assets:Checking:SBI           25000.00 INR\n    Equity:OpeningBalance\n</code></pre> <p>Let's assume you bought 8 units of SGB issued on 26<sup>th</sup> November 2015.
